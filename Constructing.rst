Constructing a Shape from scratch
=================================

Hopefully you've got enough idea about the way that vertices, normals,
texture coordinates and faces fit together now to have a go at creating
something from scratch. This isn't the way that pi3d is normally used -
there are plenty of "standard" shapes, as well as the ability to import
3D models, but this exercise should be a valuable aid to understanding
what the capabilities are and how to get round any limitations you might
find.

The scope is intentionally ambitious: A procedurally generated city with
two different building types with variable, realistic surface textures
