Textures, Lights and Shaders
============================

We've touched on the roles of these three classes previously but in this
chapter I hope to give much more detail of how they fit together and how
they can be used.

First of all have a look at the next illustration program textures01.py
and run it to see what it does. The code starts from 3D_matrices03.py but
replaces the yellow material of the cube with an image textures, the docstrings
explain the changes.

Before looking at the next texture example it would be a good idea to see
what Light does so open up and run the light01.py example. Again, much of the
explanation that I would have put here is in the docstrings so read them
and try the experiments suggested in the text.
